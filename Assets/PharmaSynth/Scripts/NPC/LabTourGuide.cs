/// timer, Pharmee points each area out as the player physically walks up to it —
/// tablet, workbench, equipment cabinet, reagent shelf — then signs off once they've
/// seen them all. Started/stopped by PharmeeGatekeeper; speaks through its narration

/// gatekeeper falls back to the timed sequence. Pure proximity core is self-tested.
